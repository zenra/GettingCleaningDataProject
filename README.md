# Summary of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset[1]

This project summarises the dataset from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones study[1]. Only the mean value and standard deviation of the measurements taken in the study are included. Each of these are averaged against each subject and activity pair to product a tidy dataset.

## Files

* *README.md*
* *tidydataset.txt*: the summary dataset of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
* *run_analysis.R*: the R script to reproduce the summary dataset as a text file. Running the R script will create a directory inside the script's own location and download the original raw dataset in the new directory. The raw dataset is then processed and the output text file saved in the same directory.
* *codebook.md*: details about the variables in the summary dataset
